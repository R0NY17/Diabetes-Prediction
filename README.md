## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** to build a classification model that predicts whether an individual has diabetes. It includes:

- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- EDA & feature importance
- Model comparison (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN)
- Best model: **Random Forest** with ~76% accuracy
- A fully interactive **Streamlit web app** for real-time predictions

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Users input health parameters (e.g. glucose, BMI, age)
2. Model predicts whether the person is likely to have diabetes
3. Built with a trained Random Forest model and standardized input features
